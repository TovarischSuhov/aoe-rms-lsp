# XS Parsing — consuming the xs cell

Domain: parsing XS sources (standalone .xs files and inline RMS blocks)
and navigating the AST. Target audience: implementers of the analysis
and server cells.

## Parse and collect diagnostics

```go
xsFile, xsDiags := xs.XsParse(text, uri)
// partial AST + syntax diagnostics sorted by position

## Symbol lookup (hover, completion)

```go
if name, ok := xsFile.SymbolAt(pos); ok {
    if fn, found := store.Function(name); found {
        // hover: fn signature + desc; completion trigger on "("
    }
}

Preconditions:
- Parse accepts any C-like input incl. the 5k-line prelude.xs fixture —
  do not pre-validate the source.
- SymbolAt on a call expression returns the callee name, not the argument.
